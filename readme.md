Board game with mines
=====================

Rules of the game are as follows
--------------------------------

1. The board is 8 by 8 in size
2. A player starts on the bottom-left square
3. A player can move their piece up, down, left or right one square by entering U, D, L or R
respectively
4. A random number of squares are ‘landmines’
5. The aim of the game is to get to the top side of the board without hitting more than 2
landmines.
6. Following each move the game displays the new location and whether any landmines were hit,
plus whether the game has been lost (more than 2 land mines hit) or won (reached the top of
the board)
